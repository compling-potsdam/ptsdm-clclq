### Abstract

Large Language Models know everything. Or do they? Language models know a lot about language and have encyclopedic knowledge, BUT they learn in a very different learning progression than humans do. In my talk, I explain briefly some of what is know about how human language acquisition and the role of emotion in language. I then explain why robots can play a role in modelling the process and talk about my ongoing research on small, multimodal, and emotional language models that are trained in a human-robot interaction setting.
