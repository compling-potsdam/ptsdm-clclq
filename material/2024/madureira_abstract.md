### Abstract

When humans engage in a conversation, many cognitive, linguistic and social forces and constraints are at play simultaneously. In particular, each utterance incrementally enriches the participants’ common ground by making new bits of information accumulate into their shared set of knowledge, experiences, suppositions, beliefs and memories. To make it happen, they must understand each other, keep track of what has been shared, and collaborate to solve misunderstandings. Modelling this grounding process is evidently very challenging, but also vital both to shed light on how human dialogue works and to build applications that can safely interact with humans. The field of NLP has seen advancements with data-driven, end-to-end deep learning models, but this prevailing paradigm also has conceptual frailties when it comes to processing dialogue phenomena: in vogue encoders are by nature not incremental, static datasets abstract away many aspects of interactivity, and hidden representations are not directly interpretable. In this thesis, I evaluate the grounding competence of deep learning dialogue models from three perspectives: (i) incremental understanding with timing and revisions; (ii) making facts shared and processing the conversation history through the lens of theory of mind; and (iii) requesting for clarifications while taking actions and dealing with uncertainty in collaborative settings. With a reflective summary of my publications on these three themes, I argue that cognitively motivated evaluation is an effective and useful approach to appreciate what current models, including chat-optimised LLMs, can do while standing on firm grounds about their limitations and, most importantly, the ethical concerns that their development and use raise.


### Bio

Brielen is currently a research assistant doing a Ph.D. at the University of Potsdam, Germany, as a member of Prof. David Schlangen's Computational Linguistics Lab (colabPotsdam). Her current research interests are building common ground in multimodal dialogue, incremental processing, and understanding the limits of current neural network models to process dialogue phenomena. She is more broadly interested in all aspects of evaluation of language technologies and in Ethics in NLP, and also enjoys doing data analysis. Brielen got her M.Sc. degree in Language Science and Technology from the University of Saarland, Germany. Before that, she received a B.Sc. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of São Paulo, Brazil.
