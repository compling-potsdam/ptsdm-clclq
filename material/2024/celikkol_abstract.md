*July 9th, 2024*


### Abstract

Scene understanding is a complex process involving the viewer's world knowledge, expectancies, tasks, and goals. This project investigates the top-down guidance of visual and linguistic processing during scene viewing and describing. I will present eye-tracking evidence for the influence of high-level scene-object relations on attentional guidance and discuss the correlation between fixation behavior and sequentialization in verbal scene descriptions. I will discuss the linkage in attentional priority during visual encoding and linguistic decoding processes and argue the potential shared mechanisms rooted in high-level world knowledge.
