### Abstract

Referring is an ubiquitous phenomenon of language which attracted both philosophers and computational linguistic. As such it should be very useful for a robot to master it too! But can we compile the human reference generation in an way which computers can understand? Dale and Reiter formulated an intriguing effective algorithm in the mid 90s which respects the human preference during the production process. This Incremental Algorithm yields promising results for the generation of referring expressions, when the world is perfectly grounded into a knowledge base. Unfortunately, this is usually not the case and we should take the receiver of the reference into account. As such referring is actually a highly collaborative endeavour as Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) have observed. In their view a reference is presented by the speaker which needs to be accepted by the addressee to be mutually understood. This grounding process happens usually interactively, though it could be very dangerous to teach it to a robot in the lab by trial and error, for example in a pick and place game with a robot arm. To make matters worse, you may have heard that the promising neural network based models need a lot of training data to get anything right. I will present my current research on the matter of "Learning to Ground References Interactively in Vision-and-Language Simulation" and we will find out who might be a useful candidate for this training process.

### Bio

Philipp is currently a research assistant doing his Ph.D. at the University of Potsdam (Germany) as a member of Prof. David Schlangen's Computational Linguistics Lab (colabPotsdam). His current research interests is to test the learning limits of current neural network models to mimic human language phenomena, especially in learning from interaction. He is more broadly interested in aspects of collaborative language technologies and in NLP task that combine multiple modalities. Philipp got his M.Sc. degree in Cognitive System at the University of Potsdam (Germany). Before that, he received a B.Sc. in Applied Computer Science from the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (Germany) and he worked several years as a software engineer.
