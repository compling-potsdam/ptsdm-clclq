### Abstract


A question is a function that takes its answer to give back a declarative sentence (Hamblin 1958, Krifka 2001): "Is it red? Yes" is interpreted as "It is red", "Is it red? No" is interpreted as "It is not red".  Kruszewski et al 2016 claim conversational negation creates the alternative set: "It is not red" should be interpreted as "It is yellow, pink etc." Negative sentences are harder to be processed than positive ones, but when the negative sentence is visually grounded the alternative set is available and processing it is faster (Nordmeyer and Frank 2014).

With this background in mind, we study Visual Dialogues consisting of polar questions. We wonder to which extent SOTA models take the answers into account and in particular whether they handle positively/negatively answered questions equally well. We run an online experiment with humans and compare models' behaviour against humans'.
