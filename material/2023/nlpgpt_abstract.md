# Open Discussion: NLP in the Age of ChatGPT et al.

We live in bizarre times. Within the space of a few months, "language modelling" has moved from being an exercise in applied probability theory to a conversation topic with your parents and your old friends from school. Rumor has it that "Natural Language Processing" as an engineering discipline, and maybe as a scientific discipline as well, is "solved", and that the future role of NLP workers at best is as prompt designers.

What are the real consequences of this hype, specifically on research in NLP? Are there indeed research projects that aren't viable anymore? And are there ones that are still viable? Are there research programs that only now have become viable?

We want to discuss questions like these with you -- students of NLP, especially from the Master's Cognitive Systems, but our Bachelor's and others beyond
are welcome as well. Has the influx of new models had an impact on your studies? (Other than having to explain to relatives and friends whether ChatGPT really will kill us all.) For those of you who are working or interning at NLP companies, how has the impact been there?

We can also use some of the time to discuss what you would see as fair rules for the use of LLMs in a University context. What kinds of uses (e.g., to help learning, or in connection to assignments and term papers) would you feel fair? safe? defensible? inacceptable?
