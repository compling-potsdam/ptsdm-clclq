### Abstract

In this talk we discuss the role and design of social robots. We
consider their context as an example of an 'intelligent machine' and
explore what a pragmatic view of intelligence means for such robots.

Looking at advances in the physical movement design of robots, we argue
how the same approach might be applied in the speech and language
domain with a focus on speech interactivity. We enumerate the required
elements in designing social robots for good speech interaction and
the challenge of integrating this with task intelligence.

We take an Applied AI approach to addressing how we might improve the
design of social robot speech interaction: we look at current
functionality in speech synthesis that can support such functionality
and introduce the concept of a conversational listener; we descibe and
demonstrate an implementation of a conversational listener and consider
how it may be developed and integrated into a social robot.

We suggest two approaches to integration: 1. Rather than make smart
systems which interact badly, let's make dumb systems that interact
well; 2. The co-design of interactive systems for the disabled and
severely disabled.

We believe the opportunity for engineers and designers working with
social robots to help and support the disabled community is a cause
for good, and a productive means of furthering the technology.



### Bio

Dr Aylett is an Associate Professor at Heriot Watt and a co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of CereProc, a speech synthesis company based in Edinburgh, Scotland. He holds the titles of Royal Society Industrial Fellowship alumnus and Honorary Fellow at the School of Informatics, at the University of Edinburgh. He received his PhD and MSc in Speech and Language Technology from the University of Edinburgh and holds a BAHons in Computing and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Sussex.

Dr Aylett also serves as the Deputy Chief Scientist of the Scott Morgan Foundation(SMF) where they develop assistive technologies to empower people with disabilities such as Motor Neuron Disease (MND) and other life-challenging conditions to lead full and socially rich lives. The Scott Morgan Foundation is a philanthropic foundation established by Dr. Peter Scott Morgan who himself suffered from MND. The goal of SMF is to use human-centered AI and cutting-edge technology to improve accessibility for disabled people, thus transforming their lives for the better. SMF has partnered with CereProc, enabling them to create text-to-speech solutions to develop a rich and vibrant voice, complete with emotion and character for people with speaking disabilities.
