# Information Extraction in Low-Resource Domains and Languages

*Leonhard Hennig, DFKI (Berlin)*

*June 14th*

### Abstract

As other NLP technologies, Information Extraction has benefited strongly from recent developments in the field.  Transfering state-of-the-art approaches to  novel domains and languages with little or no training data is nevertheless a major challenge in many applied research projects. In this talk, I will give an overview of applied information extraction research at DFKI, and present some of the approaches that we developed with our partners in various research projects.


### Bio

Leonhard Hennig is a senior researcher and project manager at the DFKI Speech & Language Technology Lab. He is interested in applying machine learning techniques to computational linguistics problems, such as information extraction and summarization, and making these work on real-world, domain-specific, noisy data in low-resource settings, where little or no language resources are readily available. As a project lead, he has managed various national research projects, such as Smart Data Web, PLASS, DAYSTREAM, and the DFKI part in the Berlin Big Data Center, as well as industry-funded projects, e.g. for Deutsche Telekom and Lenovo.
