# Interesting Times -- Are We Witnessing the End of Classical NLP and the Beginning of Ethical AI?

*Aljoscha Burchardt (DFKI Berlin)*

*July 19th, 2023*


### Abstract

My presentation will consist of three parts that should provide food for thought for discussion. In the first part, I will present a short, personally coloured history on NLP, arguing that a constant loss of control / scientific insight went hand-in-hand with improved system performance. In a second part, I will ask the question what can be meant by ethical AI. Finally, I will comment a little bit on ongoing regulatory initiatives.
