### Abstract

Despite recent advances in NLP, language processing in embodied AI agents still faces many challenges. Human language not only needs to ground to agents’ perception and action but also needs to facilitate mutual understanding and collaboration.   To address these challenges. I will give a brief introduction to some recent work in my lab.  I will present a study that explicitly tracks belief states and measures common ground in situated collaborative tasks. I will discuss the use of long-term and short-term memory to facilitate language generation that adapts to the disparities between partners. I will further introduce - Tiered Reasoning for Intuitive Physics (TRIP) – a dataset with dense annotations to address coherent and verifiable reasoning that’s critical for transparency in human-AI collaboration.

### Bio

Joyce Chai is a Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. She holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University. Before joining UM in 2019, she was a Professor of Computer Science at Michigan State University. Her research interests include natural language processing, situated dialogue, and embodied AI. Her recent work has focused on grounded language processing to facilitate situated communication between humans and embodied agents. She has served on the executive board of the North America Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) and as Program co-chair for multiple conferences - most recently the 2020 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).  She is a recipient of several Paper Awards (e.g., Best Long Paper Award at ACL2010, Outstanding Paper Award at EMNLP2021), the Career Award from the National Science Foundation (2004), and the William Beal Distinguished Scholar Award from MSU (2018).  She is a Fellow of ACL.
