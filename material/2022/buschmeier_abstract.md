# Conversational Agent ‘Perspectives’ on the Human Interlocutor

### Abstract

In conversation, interlocutors tailor their utterances to each other. They monitor whether they are being understood and adapt accordingly, reason about and take the interlocutor's perspective, and express themselves in socially appropriate ways, taking extralinguistic social influences into account.

I will present work on computational models of ‘perspectives‘ on the human interlocutor that work at different levels of processing in an artificial conversational agent: (1) low level coordination using (multimodal) linguistic feedback and adaptation in an information presentation setting; (2) adjusting to the interlocutor's perspective after clarification in a reference game; (3) politeness processing given the role of and the relationship to the interaction partner.


### Bio

I am a tenure-track assistant professor (Juniorprofessor) of Digital Linguistics at the Faculty of Linguistics and Literary Studies, Bielefeld University.

I received a PhD in Computer Science from the Faculty of Technology, Bielefeld University and have worked in the CITEC research group Social Cognitive Systems Group (Stefan Kopp). I have been involved in the research projects KOMPASS (BMBF-funded), ‘Rhythm and Timing in Dialogue’ (DFG-funded), and ‘Dialogue Coordination for Sociable Agents’ (CITEC-internal funding). My general area of interest is computational modelling of the representations, processes, and behaviours underlying the human capability for interacting in dialogue.
