### Abstract

In this talk I will provide a short review of the last 20 years of data-driven development of conversational AI (aka dialogue systems) in 5 acts:
1) rule-based systems informed by data, 2) optimising systems using Reinforcement Learning, 3) neural end-to-end systems 4) massively pretrained models, 5) future directions.
I will reflect on these developments through the lens of systems and initiatives I was involved in.
Throughout my talk, I will focus on the sub-task of response generation, for which I will highlight lessons learnt and ongoing challenges.
