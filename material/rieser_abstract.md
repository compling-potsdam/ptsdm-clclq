### Abstract

In this talk I will provide a short review of the last 20 years of data-driven development of conversational AI (aka dialogue systems) through the lens of 5 major systems and initiatives I was involved in: I will start by reviewing the beginnings of customer-driven rule-based systems, corpus-based studies, optimising systems using Reinforcement Learning and finally neural end-to-end systems -- including open-domain and task-based systems. 
Throughout my talk, I will focus on the sub-task of response generation, for which I will highlight lessons learnt and ongoing challenges. 
In particular, I will argue that neural models lack control over what is generated, are not customer-driven, nor able to adapt in real-time and don't show system initiative. I will then provide a short overview of how my team aims to address these challenges, including visual- and symbolic grounding, common sense reasoning, evaluation practises and persona design.
