### Abstract

While NLP has advanced considerably in recent years, state-of-the-art models can no longer easily be inspected and understood directly. This talk presents a series of interpretable approaches for affect and semantics-related settings.

The first part of the talk will present interpretable vectors custom-tailored for emotions and their connections to words, fonts, and colors. Subsequently, I will discuss NLP approaches for emojis and their connection to emotion. The final part of the talk will consider structured representations to better model the structure of a sentence or other kinds of knowledge that may be useful in downstream applications.
