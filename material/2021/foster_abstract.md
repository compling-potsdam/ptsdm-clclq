### Abstract

When humans talk to each other face-to-face, they use their voices, faces, and bodies together in a rich, multimodal, continuous, interactive process. For a robot to participate fully in this sort of natural, face-to-face conversation in the real world, it must also be able not only to understand the social signals of its human partners, but also to produce appropriate signals in response. I will present recent research in this area, and will also discuss the emerging ethical implications of real-world deployment of socially intelligent robots.
