### Abstract

In this talk I will present work done at Google aimed to make progress towards a more trustworthy natural language processing. We will first establish what trustworthiness and trust mean, and when we can say that a system is trustworthy. We'll then discuss what criteria a trustworthy NLP system should meet, before we look at recent work done at Google towards this end.
