## Abstract

Multimodal cohesion is a method that describes and analyzes the means by which narrative discourse structures are "bound together" by information from different channels, e.g., visual, auditory, and verbal. Here we present an exploratory experimental investigation of how multimedial cohesion guides visual attention and narrative understanding. Using a cohesion analysis we identified important multimodal cues that film directors use to establish the setting of a scene and its semantic interpretation. We manipulated scenes by blurring important cues to the setting or by altering the soundtrack or verbal cues, and recorded viewers' eye movements as well as questionnaire data about the scene. Eye movement recordings suggest that removal of cues (a) caused less attention to be allocated to the blurred parts of an edited sceneâ€“which can be considered a manipulation check, and (b) led to uncertainty about the setting of the subsequent unedited scene, which triggered active search behaviour in order to reduce that uncertainty. Questionnaire results supported this interpretation: Viewers of modified scenes were less certain about the specific identity of the setting, and replaced it with a more generic identity. Taken together, our results using experimental manipulations of film material show that film directors employ multimodal cohesive cues to guide their viewers attention and narrative comprehension.
