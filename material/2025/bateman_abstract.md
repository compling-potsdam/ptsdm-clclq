### Abstract


Several quite extensive accounts of discourse coherence
have been developed for verbal language over the
years. Moreover, many core issues of multimodality, such as 'meaning multiplication' and cross- and transmodal meaning-making, can be argued to make essentially discourse-level contributions as well.
When turning to multimodal communication, therefore, we might have expected an equally broad, if not broader, recognition of discourse semantics. Somewhat paradoxically, however, only a few accounts of multimodality give discourse semantics much attention. In contrast, in the approach to multimodal semiotics we have been developing over the past 20 years, first in Bremen and now at several other locations, discourse semantics is assigned a key position. Consqeutnly, in this talk I briefly motivate and introduce this account and then, using examples primarily but not only from comics and graphic novels, open up a discussion concerning the extent to
which the assumption of an appropriate discourse semantics
not only helps characterise complex visual narratives
more effectively but also raises interesting challenges for the nature of discourse semantics as such.
