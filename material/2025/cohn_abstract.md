## Abstract

For over two decades Visual Language Theory (VLT) has provided a linguistic and cognitive framework to explain how graphics and comics are comprehended by balancing linguistic theories with empirical corpus analyses and (neuro)cognitive experiments. I will provide an overview of VLT to argue that comprehending the visual sequence of a comic involves readers balancing structures of the visual layout the meaning of both images and their sequence and a narrative structure which facilitates this sequential meaning. Readers work to construct cognitive architectures for each of these structures in parallel and for their relationships. For each structure this involves stages of accessing a particular type of knowledge using that knowledge to make predictions about upcoming information and then updating this knowledge based on the degree to which new information aligns with those predictions. I will discuss how this progression of cognitive processes manifests across layout meaning and narrative in eye-movements durations of reading times and direct measurements of the brain.
