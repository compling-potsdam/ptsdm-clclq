# Potsdam Computational Linguistics Colloquium, Summer 2020

New (2020-03-23): Things are still a bit up in the air, but it looks like the whole semester, or at the very least major parts of it, will happen online in some form or other. So, the dates as they stand here are confirmed, but the presentations will be remote. Local students and staff: Please sign up on moodle for `cl-colloquium-2020` -- you will find the link to the remote meeting there on the day of the talk. Externals interesting in joining: Please email me (David Schlangen) & I'll send you the link.

BSc students: It will be possible to get credit for taking this class ("Schl√ºsselqualifikationen"). If you are interested in this, come to the session on April 22. (Details will be shown in the comments on the PULS entry for the class.)
