# Potsdam Computational Linguistics Colloquium, Summer 2024

Another summer semester, another edition of the PCLC!

This year, we are putting the focus a little bit more on things that are going on here in Potsdam, but we'll have some great external speakers as well. (Stay tuned, not yet ready to be announced.)



While some of the talks will be given remotely via zoom (which will be clearly marked below), most will be given in person (room 0.09, building 14, Golm). 

(All talks will be from 4-6 pm CEST on the respective day, unless otherwise noted.)
