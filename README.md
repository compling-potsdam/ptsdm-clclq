# Potsdam Computational Linguistics Colloquium, Summer 2025

Another summer semester, another edition of the PCLC!

This year, most slots will be filled with internal events (default if not otherwise noted), but we'll have some great external speakers as well.

While some of the talks will be given remotely via zoom (which will be clearly marked below), most will be given in person (room 0.35, building 14, Golm). 

(All talks will be from 4-6 pm CEST on the respective day, unless otherwise noted.)
